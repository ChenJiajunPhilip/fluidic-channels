# fluidic-channels
Fluidic channels are generalisations for fluids that flow from left to right, as represented in 2D by the black pixels in the images.  
This repository documents the various functions on fluidic channels that can be generated by chatGPT via prompting chatGPT through a python script. After the function is generated, the script checks the performance of the function in comparison with a ground truth function (the true function which is not accesible to chatGPT), and if the difference in value (i.e. error) is higher than an arbitrary user defined value, then the script will repeatedly promopt chatGPT to try again, each time providing additional feedback to the initial base prompt, including details of how much was the error and how it should imporve.  

### 6 geometric functions:
1. Volume of fluid (VOF) --> find_vof_actual: Ratio of fluid region to overall rectangular design space, will range between 0 to 1

2. Number of outlets --> num_outlets_actual: Number of outlet channels

3. Average outlet channel thickness --> outlet_thicknesses_actual: The average ratio thickness of the outlet channel, with respect to overall height of design space, will range between 0 to 1

4. Average inlet channel thickness --> inlet_thicknesses_actual: The average ratio thickness of the inlet channel, with respect to overall height of design space, will range between 0 to 1

5. Periemter --> perimeter_actual: The number of pixels that surround the black fluid region, note that this function depends on subtract_inlet() and subtract_outlet() functions

6. Connectivity --> connectivity_actual: The number of instances where channels diverge or converge, should be a count integer number
