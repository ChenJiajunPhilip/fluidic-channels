# fluidic-channels
Fluidic channels are generalisations for fluids that flow from left to right, as represented in 2D by the black pixels in the images.  
This repository documents the various functions on fluidic channels that can be generated by chatGPT via prompting chatGPT through a python script. After the function is generated, the script checks the performance of the function in comparison with a ground truth function (the true function which is not accesible to chatGPT), and if the difference in value (i.e. error) is higher than an arbitrary user defined value, then the script will repeatedly promopt chatGPT to try again, each time providing additional feedback to the initial base prompt, including details of how much was the error and how it should imporve. 
Examples of fluidic channels are as shown below:
